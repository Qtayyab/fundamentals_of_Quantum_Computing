# fundamentals_of_Quantum_Computing
It is a repository based on basics of Quantum computing that I learned in a course on LinkedIn Learning. You can access course through this    https://www.linkedin.com/learning/quantum-computing-fundamentals?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A624e1280498eef99568f1926
It is a very interesting course and really worth it to start with quantum computing.
